# Notebook for AP World History
(_I know I'm a nerd, taking notes with **Markdown** :-)_

## Random vocabulary
- **Identify**: Give a name of the thing.
- **Describe**: Identify, and tell a bit more about it.
- **Historical development**: A thing that happened in the past, just once.
- **Historical process**: A thing that happened in the past gradually over time.
    * To write clearly about a process, say something like *the weakening of the Ming Dynasty*, instead of *the Ming Dynasty fell*.

## A note on the AP Exam
1. **Learning objective**: A very general claim. That will be what a typical essay question on the AP exam.
    - *Ex. Explain the effects of Chinese cultural traditions on East Asia over time.*
2. ***ALWAYS*** write complete sentences! Without sentences, NO POINTS will be given!
3. You should begin the answer with the prompt. Make your answer as clear as possible.

Tips: Do **NOT** memorize the small points! The point is to link big ideas to small examples.

## 1.1 Developments in East Asia
Cultural traditions
- Filial piety: Respect for people older than one, especially parents
- Confucian idea

### China: Government developments
* By this time, China is one of the most successful coutries in the world
* Reason: China has a **imperial bureaucracy** (People doing jobs)
* The special thing about the Chinese bureaucracy: It's really old, since the Qin Dynasty
* Over time, it got very big (food, military, education, ...)
* Another unique thing: The bureaucracy is a **meritocracy**, which means the people inside have merit (they deserve the job)
* **Civil Service Exam**: Used to determine who has merit
    - CONTINUITY: The Chinese still value THE TEST!
* Also has long history: dates back to the Han Dynasty
* With enough education, technically anyone can get a good grade and a good position, but poor are underrepresented (time for scores, no time for poor)

### China: Social structures
* **Scholar gentry**: A new class of people who passed the CSE and got a high level job
* Confucian values shaped the Chinese social structure

### China: Intellectual developments
* People are wealthy in the Song Dynasty from trading
* Agricultureal improvements created food surplus, so peopple are well-fed
* Also well educated because of the Civil Service Exam
* **Woodblock painting**: New technology, copying books faster, supply++, demand++, and now people are reading more and getting smarter
    - *Scholar gentry* grows, more books written

### Chamba rice
* Song Dynasty: 302 envoys, Champa is one of them
* Many countries take things from China, willngly or forced
* Champa, however, is NOT super Chinese; more influence from Champa rice
    - Language: Sanskrit
    - Religion: Hindu
* Champa rice is probably gotten from south Asia
* Gift to China in 1000 CE: **rice**
* At that time, it seems like a weak gift as China has lots of rice already
* However Champa rice has a LOT of advantages
    - Ripens in ~60 days, a third the time of normal rice
    - More resistant to drought
    - Needs less sunlight
    - More yield
* Emperor Zhengzong immediately ordered 30,000 bushels (1 bushel = 35 liters) and planted it anywhere
* Super big effects in China
    1. Population explosion: Population *DOUBLES*! End of Song, China = 40% population of world
    2. Political safety: Mandate of Heaven kept even with 1012 drought
    3. Food security => More specialization: No need to wonder where the next meal will come from, so people can pend time worrying about specializing and getting better at what they like doing


## 1.2 Developments in Dar al-Islam
* Dar al-Islam: lit. "the house of Islam", anywhere where Islam is the main religion
* In 1200, includes Middle East, North Africa, SW Europe, and more of South Asia
* Things to talk about:
    1. The rise to power of **Turkic** Muslim people
    2. The spread of Islam

### Rise of Islam
* As Abbasid Caliphate dissolves, new Islamic states emerge
    - **Continuity** in innovation and diversity (in religions, ethnic, culture)
* ***CED***: Seljik Turks
    - Muslims from Central Asia, conquered parts of Middle East
    - Leader: **Sultan** (sol-TANG), head of state, only political power
    - Before that were **Caliph**s: Leader of Muslim community, religious power, but now they're gone
    - Some Sultans try to be a Caliph but that's almost never successful
    - Important things done: Captured Jerusalem, Christians can't get there any more
        - Christians went on a lot of **Crusades** to try to reclaim the holy land, some of which almost didn't fail
        - Weakened the church, made outer world visible to Europeans which encourages exploration (there are so much good stuff like spices, tea, etc.)
* ***CED***: Mamluks
    - Enslaved Turks bought by Arabs, but treated relatively well as slaves (some can get some power/money)
    - Mamluks took control of much of Egypt and the Mamluk **Sultanate** lasted 300 years
    - *(They were so good at fighting they won against the Mongols)*
* ***CED***: Delhi Sultanate
    - Took control of some of South Asia
    - Islam appeals to low caste Hindus, grew popular where Hinduism was weaker
    - A lot of violence at the start (Hinduism polytheistic, Islam monotheistic)
    - Low number of Turks ruling many people
* Continuity
    - Continue religion tolerance
    - Continue innovation, science, medicine
    - **House of Wisdom**: Translate ancient books from Rome etc., make more advancements

### Spread of Islam
1. Trade
    - Mostly an accident that the religion spreads
    - Run into people who are interested in the religion
    - Some people pretend to convert just to trade better
2. War / Conquest
    - Biggest place: Jerusalem
    - Another place: **Spain**
3. Missionaries
    - People who run around, knock on your door, and say, "Have you hear of our prophet?"
    - A group of people: **Sufis** (Sufism is a type of Islam)
        - *Mystics*, a personal form of the religion, doesn't rely on book/leader, they form a relationship with their own religion
        - People talking to mystics are likely going to get interested in the religion and convert

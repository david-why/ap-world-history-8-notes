# Notebook for AP World History
(_I know I'm a nerd, taking notes with **Markdown** :-)_

## Random vocabulary
- **Identify**: Give a name of the thing.
- **Describe**: Identify, and tell a bit more about it.
- **Contextualization**: Showing how the process/development relates to other things in the period of time
- **Historical development**: A thing that happened in the past, just once.
- **Historical process**: A thing that happened in the past gradually over time.
    * To write clearly about a process, say something like *the weakening of the Ming Dynasty*, instead of *the Ming Dynasty fell*.

## A note on the AP Exam
1. **Learning objective**: A very general claim. That will be what a typical essay question on the AP exam.
    - *Ex. Explain the effects of Chinese cultural traditions on East Asia over time.*
2. ***ALWAYS*** write complete sentences! Without sentences, NO POINTS will be given!
3. You should begin the answer with the prompt. Make your answer as clear as possible.

Tips: Do **NOT** memorize the small points! The point is to link big ideas to small examples.

## 1.1 Developments in East Asia
Cultural traditions
- Filial piety: Respect for people older than one, especially parents
- Confucian idea

### China: Government developments
* By this time, China is one of the most successful coutries in the world
* Reason: China has a **imperial bureaucracy** (People doing jobs)
* The special thing about the Chinese bureaucracy: It's really old, since the Qin Dynasty
* Over time, it got very big (food, military, education, ...)
* Another unique thing: The bureaucracy is a **meritocracy**, which means the people inside have merit (they deserve the job)
* **Civil Service Exam**: Used to determine who has merit
    - CONTINUITY: The Chinese still value THE TEST!
* Also has long history: dates back to the Han Dynasty
* With enough education, technically anyone can get a good grade and a good position, but poor are underrepresented (time for scores, no time for poor)

### China: Social structures
* **Scholar gentry**: A new class of people who passed the CSE and got a high level job
* Confucian values shaped the Chinese social structure

### China: Intellectual developments
* People are wealthy in the Song Dynasty from trading
* Agricultureal improvements created food surplus, so peopple are well-fed
* Also well educated because of the Civil Service Exam
* **Woodblock painting**: New technology, copying books faster, supply++, demand++, and now people are reading more and getting smarter
    - *Scholar gentry* grows, more books written

### Chamba rice
* Song Dynasty: 302 envoys, Champa is one of them
* Many countries take things from China, willngly or forced
* Champa, however, is NOT super Chinese; more influence from Champa rice
    - Language: Sanskrit
    - Religion: Hindu
* Champa rice is probably gotten from south Asia
* Gift to China in 1000 CE: **rice**
* At that time, it seems like a weak gift as China has lots of rice already
* However Champa rice has a LOT of advantages
    - Ripens in ~60 days, a third the time of normal rice
    - More resistant to drought
    - Needs less sunlight
    - More yield
* Emperor Zhengzong immediately ordered 30,000 bushels (1 bushel = 35 liters) and planted it anywhere
* Super big effects in China
    1. Population explosion: Population *DOUBLES*! End of Song, China = 40% population of world
    2. Political safety: Mandate of Heaven kept even with 1012 drought
    3. Food security => More specialization: No need to wonder where the next meal will come from, so people can pend time worrying about specializing and getting better at what they like doing


## 1.2 Developments in Dar al-Islam
* Dar al-Islam: lit. "the house of Islam", anywhere where Islam is the main religion
* In 1200, includes Middle East, North Africa, SW Europe, and more of South Asia
* Things to talk about:
    1. The rise to power of **Turkic** Muslim people
    2. The spread of Islam

### Rise of Islam
* As Abbasid Caliphate dissolves, new Islamic states emerge
    - **Continuity** in innovation and diversity (in religions, ethnic, culture)
* ***CED***: Seljik Turks
    - Muslims from Central Asia, conquered parts of Middle East
    - Leader: **Sultan** (sol-TANG), head of state, only political power
    - Before that were **Caliph**s: Leader of Muslim community, religious power, but now they're gone
    - Some Sultans try to be a Caliph but that's almost never successful
    - Important things done: Captured Jerusalem, Christians can't get there any more
        - Christians went on a lot of **Crusades** to try to reclaim the holy land, some of which almost didn't fail
        - Weakened the church, made outer world visible to Europeans which encourages exploration (there are so much good stuff like spices, tea, etc.)
* ***CED***: Mamluks
    - Enslaved Turks bought by Arabs, but treated relatively well as slaves (some can get some power/money)
    - Mamluks took control of much of Egypt and the Mamluk **Sultanate** lasted 300 years
    - *(They were so good at fighting they won against the Mongols)*
* ***CED***: Delhi Sultanate
    - Took control of some of South Asia
    - Islam appeals to low caste Hindus, grew popular where Hinduism was weaker
    - A lot of violence at the start (Hinduism polytheistic, Islam monotheistic)
    - Low number of Turks ruling many people
* Continuity
    - Continue religion tolerance
    - Continue innovation, science, medicine
    - **House of Wisdom**: Translate ancient books from Rome etc., make more advancements

### Spread of Islam
1. Trade
    - Mostly an accident that the religion spreads
    - Run into people who are interested in the religion
    - Some people pretend to convert just to trade better
2. War / Conquest
    - Biggest place: Jerusalem
    - Another place: **Spain**
3. Missionaries
    - People who run around, knock on your door, and say, "Have you hear of our prophet?"
    - A group of people: **Sufis** (Sufism is a type of Islam)
        - *Mystics*, a personal form of the religion, doesn't rely on book/leader, they form a relationship with their own religion
        - People talking to mystics are likely going to get interested in the religion and convert

### Intellectual innovation
* Three things
    * Preservation and commentary of Greeks
    * Baghdad House of Wisdom
    * Scholarly and cultural transfer in Muslim and Christian Spain

* **CORE TAKEAWAY**: Muslims are smart and they collected knowledge around the world and shared their smartness with others through trade

* What is the House of Wisdom? We need ***context***
    * *Spread of Islam*: How did those book translators get powerful?
    * *"Dark ages" in Europe*: Why are *Muslims* translating European stuff instead of themselves?
    * *Spread of trade networks*: How Muslims spread this good intellectual stuff

* **Spread of Islam**
    * Muhammad created in the 600s
    * At first stays pretty much local in the region
    * After Muhammad's death Umayyad Caliphate spread Islam in to N.Africa and Spain
    * In Abassid Caliphate the Islam empire shrinks a little bit

* **Decline of Europe**
    * 400s CE, Roman Empire fell with no replacement (another strong empire)
    * Replaced with small weak kingdoms
    * Not many resources to support education, technology, etc. (called the **"dark ages"**)
        - These stuff still happen but WAY less than Roman/Greek Empires

* **Expansion of Trade Networks**
    * **TWO IMPORTANT THINGS**
    1. In Period 1-2, Muslims are the dominant traders in the world (Islam empires support and respect (a lot) merchants, opportunity to get money + spread Islam + get status)
    2. In Period 1-2, Muslims spread their knowledge in the world (original knowledge, *contemporary* societies (others from the same time), past societies (House of Wisdom))

* Now we can get back to the **House of Wisdom**
    * **Where?** Baghdad (capital of Abbasid Caliphate)
    * **When?** 800s - 1258
    * **What?** We don't know because it was destroyed by the Mongols as they took over
    * **What does it do?**
        1. Translation Center
        2. Library (not the only library, but **illuminated manuscripts**: "a fancy book", cover is fragrant wood that smells good, pages are decorated with gold, solver, etc.)
    * Some of the books are more art than books: they look great but don't have a lot of text, etc.
* Well, another detour: **Abbasid Caliphate**
    * Very diverse and tolerant, much more peaceful than the Umayyads
    * Promotes culture, art, and learning
    * Invites scholars from all over the world
    * Translate text, hsare knowledge, and now we end up with the House
* People you should know
    * **Caliph al Mansur**: Founder of Baghdad
        * Ordered the Palace Library's construction, collected as many books as possible
        * Adopts Persian influences
    * **Caliph al Ma'mun** (the ' makes a "H" sound): a nerd
        * War with the Byzantine Empire, they win, Ma'mun: I'm gonna fight until I get that book that I really wanted for a long time
        * Invites Jewish and Indian scholars
        * Went to Egypt to help excavate (dig out) pyramids
        * Ordered more accurate world maps
        * Built the first observatory, the astronomical type
    * **Al Khwarizmi**: Wrote a book called *al-Jabr* abouot Algebra in 820 CE
        * Brought in Hindu numerics and now they're called "Arabic numerals"
        * Took *Geography* from Ptolemy and CORRECTED IT
        * Wrote books to make/use astrolabes
